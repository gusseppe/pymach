### Explanation: Correlation Matrix
###### **Features that are correlated (0.80 threshold)**: ['petal_length', 'petal_width']
###### **Advice**: Most likely, I'm going to drop a half of them to increase 
###### the overall performance. In the meantime, consider not include correlated variables 
###### the next time to model this dataset.
